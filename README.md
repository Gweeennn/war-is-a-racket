# USE THIS BRANCH FOR PLAYTESTING ONLY
Playtesting is very helpful for allowing developers (i.e. the person writing this) to make sure that things are functioning correctly, while also letting players to see content early. Honestly, I would recommend it BUT given how unstable this is compared to the main branch, if stability is something you actually care about, then you shouldn't be playing on this branch.
