# DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH FOR PLAYING
This branch is full of content that is disorganized and basically a chaotic mess, nobody should even be looking at this unless they are either a developer... or... well, I suppose that's the only reason someone would want to look at this. If you want to see pre-update/pre-release content, look at the dev-stable branch.
